This project describes the implementation of a basic social media system. It models an
interactive system in which a server manages shared resources, including files and processes,
between an arbitrary number of clients. Most of us are constantly making use of servers when
we use the internet. For example, when logging onto Facebook, you must immediately make a
request to a web server to access your personal account. Following this, the web server connects
with the database server, which ensures that the most up-to-date information is displayed.
Photograph and video servers process the billions of photos shared across the platform every
day and a news feed server processes huge amounts of data. This is only one application, but
it manages its resources with thousands of servers. This report outlines how a simple model of
server-client communication can be managed.
